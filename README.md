# Cordova Swift Plugin Example

**UPDATE: 1/1/2017 -- IF YOU ARE USING SWIFT 3 / XCODE 8.2 THEN USE THE SWIFT 3 UPDATE OF THIS PLUGIN -- [REPO HERE](https://github.com/ModusCreateOrg/cordova-swift3-plugin-example).**

Example Cordova plugin for iOS to support blog post.  The native part of the plugin is written in Swift rather than Objective-C.  You can read the blog post [here](http://moduscreate.com/writing-a-cordova-plugin-in-swift-for-ios/).

A simple Cordova plugin based on the [ModusEcho plugin](https://github.com/ModusCreateOrg/cordova-plugin-example) example, which in turn was based on the echo plugin example from the [Cordova documentation](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/hybrid/plugins/index.html).

* `echo` method: Extends that example to display a native dialog on iOS that auto dismisses after a short time.
* `echojs` method: Basic demo showing that plugins can also be used to organize and distribute useful JavaScript, and don't need native implementations necessarily.
